Just walked out of The Amateur and man, my head's spinning like a centrifuge. Theater's sticky, popcorn's ground underfoot like it's part of the carpet now, but who cares? That movie was a rollercoaster. Back of mine's killing me from the angle, but worth it.

> This protagonist, he plods along like a confused beetle, right? Bumbling yet brilliant, just like that nutty professor stereotype, but guy’s got layers. Like an onion. A really confused onion. Some moments I swear he channels Heisenberg with all his uncertainty. He's working with stuff that has potential to make your hair stand up or rust your bike if you know what I mean. Radioactivity metaphors thrown around like confetti, but it’s more like tear gas at some points.

The dialogue's crackling, like catching snippets of the latest conference call but thrown into chaos. People in the back arguing with the screen like it’s gonna talk back. Of course, they had to throw in a scene with the protagonist brooding over a beaker. Real Scientist material there. Do people actually do that? Felt like waiting for my PCR results—painful, tedious, but kinda thrilling.

Ah damn, did someone ask me to download the movie? No way to capture this on screen. Or was it watch the movie? Either or, wild ride if you can keep up with how much it jumps around. Forget rollercoasters, it was like strapping yourself to a half-broken gyroscope.

Remembered the bit when he’s comparing equations with love letters. Whose idea was that? Although kinda made sense in a twisted way, if you're into those romanticized equations or maybe just delusional. Suddenly he's running, like he's in those training montages—Rocky who? Spilled half my drink when the plot twist hit. Seriously though, popcorn everywhere, chaos, kind of like what goes on in a lab around deadline.

Someone behind kept coughing, maybe walked out mid-movie for air or to regain their sanity. Also, what was with the lighting choices? Half the time it felt darker than a poorly-curated basement. But when it worked, it worked like a magnetic field aligning just right.

For those asking if it’s a download the movie situation, dunno. The theater experience felt integral, but once it hits streaming, might have to watch the movie again to catch all the details.
